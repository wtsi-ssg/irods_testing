Exploring upgrading from iRODS 3.3.1 to iRODS 4.1.X, this repo contains a BATS test 
harness that aims to test both pre and post upgrade functionality.

It relies on having a test infrastructure built (we use Vagrant and Virtualbox, seperate Repo to come, maybe), named like this;

db
icat
ires1
ires2
